# About Me

Hi, my name is *Andreas Kiener*, and I am new to this. I learn to code at a bootcamp called [*neue fische*](https://www.neuefische.de). Our stack:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git
- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB

## Introduction

I've always been interested in tech, particularly in coding and the web. But before starting at *neue fische* I worked as writer and editor. You can read some of my stories in my [blog](https://headio.net), but it hasn't been updated for quite a while.

I like to train coding at Codewars:

## Questions

**Do you have a secret vice?**

Yes, but it's secret, you know? ;-) Some people would call my knack for building WordPress-sites a vice.

**What's the worst advice you ever got?**

Don't get into coding, real life doesn't happen in front of the computer screen.

**Please name some things you like!**

- Cats
- The Internet
- Cycling
- Fish (fun fact: I have a [website about fish keeping](https://nano-aquarium-tipps.de).)
- Pizza
